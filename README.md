Welcome!

I'm Jacqueline Wingen, a master’s student in Crop Sciences at the University of Bonn. This repository serves as my learning logbook for the course Tree Phenology Analysis with R. Throughout this course, I’ll be exploring the seasonal development patterns of trees using R, with a focus on tools like the chillR package, developed by Prof. Dr. Eike Luedeling. This package provides essential functions for analyzing how environmental factors, such as temperature, affect tree dormancy and flowering times.

This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.
